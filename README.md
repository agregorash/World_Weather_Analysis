# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

I have been tasked with developing a travel application that assists users with finding vacation destinations.  Utilizing JSON and API calls, this application compares real-time weather data in thousands of cities around the world and filters the destination results based on the user's weather specifications by way a marker map with hotel recommendations.  Additionally, there is a built in itinerary planner that maps out directions between the users selected destinations
